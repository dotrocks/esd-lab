\chapter{Conclusion}

In this laboratory session, we have learned how to analyze and build the Wheatstone Bridge circuit. We learned the use cases of Wheatstone Bridge and how to calculate the resistance values using the balance equation. We have successfully built the Wheatstone Bridge circuit and measured the resistance values of the resistors using a digital multimeter. We have also verified the balance equation by comparing the calculated and measured resistance values. We have also learned how to use a potentiometer to adjust the resistance value and observe the changes in the output voltage. Overall, this laboratory session was very informative and helped us understand the practical applications of Wheatstone Bridge in real-world scenarios.
