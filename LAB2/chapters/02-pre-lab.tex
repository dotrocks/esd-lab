\chapter{Pre-Lab Work}

The purpose of this pre-lab work is to prepare for this experiment (Laboratory Experiment \#2) in the ESD Capsule. This lab aims to teach students about the Wheatstone Bridge and its applications in measuring resistance values.

The pre-lab work is divided into two parts: theoretical analysis and LTspice simulations.

Outcomes of these pre-lab works will not be shown here explicitly, but will be used in the next pages of this paper with the experimental part results.

\section{Theoretical Analysis}
We analyzed the Wheatstone Bridge circuit theoretically and calculated the expected values based on the provided circuit configurations and component values.

\section{LTspice Simulations}
Using LTspice, we implemented the Wheatstone Bridge circuit and conducted simulations to verify the expected outcomes. The simulation results were appropriately labeled and aligned with the theoretical analysis.
