\chapter{Overview}

The purpose of this pre-lab report is to prepare for Laboratory Work \#2 in the ESD Capsule. This lab aims to introduce the Wheatstone Bridge and its applications. The Wheatstone Bridge is a circuit that is used to measure an unknown resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit. The Wheatstone Bridge is a fundamental circuit in electrical engineering and is used in many applications such as strain gauges, thermistors, and potentiometers. This lab will also introduce the concept of a potentiometer and its applications.
