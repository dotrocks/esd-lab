\chapter{Pre-Lab Tasks}

\section{Theoretical Analysis}
We analyzed each circuit theoretically and calculated the expected values based on the provided circuit configurations and component values.

\section{LTspice Simulations}
Using LTspice, we implemented each circuit and conducted simulations to verify the expected outcomes. The simulation results were appropriately labeled and aligned with the theoretical analysis.

\section{Resistor Colour Code}
We determined the color codes of resistors using the Resistor Colour Code and showcased the calculation process to identify the resistance values.
