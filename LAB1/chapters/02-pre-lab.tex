\chapter{Pre-Lab Work}

The purpose of this pre-lab work is to prepare for this experiment (Laboratory Experiment \#1) in the ESD Capsule. This lab aims to familiarize students with basic electronic equipment and components commonly used in laboratory settings. The tasks involve theoretical analysis, LTspice simulations, and practical measurements using laboratory instruments. 

The pre-lab work is divided into three parts: theoretical analysis, LTspice simulations, and resistor colour-code calculation.

Outcomes of these pre-lab works will not be shown here explicitly, but will be used in the next pages of this paper with the experimental part results.

\section{Theoretical Analysis}
We analyzed each circuit theoretically and calculated the expected values based on the provided circuit configurations and component values.

\section{LTspice Simulations}
Using LTspice, we implemented each circuit and conducted simulations to verify the expected outcomes. The simulation results were appropriately labeled and aligned with the theoretical analysis.

\section{Resistor Colour Code}
We determined the color codes of resistors using the Resistor Colour Code and showcased the calculation process to identify the resistance values.
